One of the most challenging problems in this project was diagnosing and fixing unstable model performance caused by incorrect preprocessing of the time-series data. The initial models—LSTM, CNN, and hybrid architectures—were either underfitting or showing large fluctuations in validation loss, which made it clear that the input pipeline was not structured correctly. To resolve this, I rebuilt the entire data preparation flow using a custom WindowGenerator that creates consistent overlapping windows and ensures proper alignment between features and labels. I also applied MinMax scaling and tested multiple window sizes to capture short-term and long-term temporal patterns. After running an ablation study across architectures, I identified that a Bidirectional LSTM with tuned dropout, batch size, and learning rate provided the best results. This redesign significantly improved prediction accuracy and produced stable, reliable validation curves, making the model suitable for real-world forecasting.
